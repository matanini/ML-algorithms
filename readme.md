This repository contains several ML algorithms, coded from scratch.  
See [helper.ipynb](helper.ipynb) for demonstaration.

Included ML algorithms:  
- Gaussian Naive Baise
- K Nearest Neighbors
- K-Means

Also included in preprocessing:
- Min-Max scaler
- T-distribution scaler

This project is for my self enjoyement and learning :).
